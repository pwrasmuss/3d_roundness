# Python implementation of "Three-dimensional Wadell roundness for particle angularity characterization of granular soils".
This package contains a python implementation of the algorithm by Junxing Zheng, Hantao He and Hossein Alimohammadi [1], which provides a method to calculate the 3D Wadell roundness.

It is based on the package _2D Wadell roundness and sphericity in Python_ which can be found at https://github.com/PaPieta/wadell_rs/tree/main.
A modified version of that package is included in this package.

## Installation
``` python
pip install git+https://github.com/pwrasmuss/3d_roundness.git
```

## User guide
See the notebook named test_spheres.ipynb for a simple example of how the algorithm works.
